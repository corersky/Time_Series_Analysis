1) Discrete Distribution 
2) Continuous Distribution

Discrete distribution is in which the output is interger. For example, the number of people has voted. The number of patients visited emergency during 1 year. 
Continuous distribution consist of the range of output. For example, the outcome of the survey finding the pH level of underground water.
