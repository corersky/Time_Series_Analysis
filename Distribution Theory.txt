There are two types of distribution theory.
1) Discrete Distribution 
2) Continuous Distribution

Discrete distribution is in which the output is interger. For example, the number of people has voted. The number of patients visited emergency during 1 year. 
Continuous distribution consist of the range of output. For example, the outcome of the survey finding the pH level of underground water. 

The following properties of the discrete distribution is very important.
1) The probability distribution function is called probabilty mass function. 
2) The cumulative distribution function is called cummulative distribution function.

These hold 3 properties, which are 
1) The probabilty mass function = f(x) should be always non negative. 
2) The f(Xi) = P(X= Xi), the probability at any point x is the value of F(x) at that point. 
3) Summation of all the probabilty at the range of X should be equal to 1. 

There are various types of Discrete Distribution:- 
a) Uniform probablity distribution
b) Binomial Distribution
c) Poission Distribution
d) Exponentional Distribution



There are many Continuous distribution, few of them are mentioned below:- 
a) Uniform Probabilty Distribution
b) Normal distribution
c) Approximate Binomial and Poission Distribution. 
d) Geometric distribution

The properties associated with the continuous distribution are as follows :- 
1) The probabilty density funciton is always a non negative value. 
2) The integration of pdf for a range of x is P(a<X<b), probabilty of the distribution in the range of a & b. 
3) The pdf at any point is always zero (0) in continious distribution systems.
