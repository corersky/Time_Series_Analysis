# Household Electricity Consumption

This is a multivariate time series analysis of power consumption which can be modeled to forecast electricity consumption. Objective of this project are as follows: -
How to create and analysis autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots for univariate time series data.
How to use the findings from autocorrelation plots to configure an autoregression model.
How to develop and evaluate an autocorrelation model used to make one-week forecasts.
This Project can be divided into 5 parts which are as follows:
1. Problem Description
2. Load and Prepare Dataset
3. Model Evaluation
4. Autocorrelation Analysis 
5. Develop an Autoregression Model
